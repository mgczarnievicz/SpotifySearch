# Spotify Search

## Overview

An interface that allows users to search their favorite artists and albums by making AJAX calls to Spotify's API via a proxy. Clicking any search result will redirect the user to the related artist/album's Spotify page.

## Feature

-   A message will display if there are no results for a search.
-   A default image will display for results that do not have any images.
-   Infinite scroll is possible only when the string "scroll=infinite" appears in the query string when the page loads. Infinite scroll allows the user to scroll down to the bottom of the listed results and the next page of results will automatically be loaded and appended to the latest results. As part of this functionality, the 'More' button disappears.
